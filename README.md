# hello-world
let's do this! I am determined!
I am an art therapy student who wants to do so much more with many opportunities and one area that doesn't have many people working on it is in game and phone applications that would be beneficial to clients using counseling and art therapy techniques. I am hoping to be able to learn more to be able to use my new skills to help other art therapists. This is my first set of changes to hopefully understand what I am doing with this program.
